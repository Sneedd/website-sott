# Security

Somehow I was dragged into security, eventually because I always had the urge to create "secure" software. At least to secure the software with the bare minimum, you would not believe what I saw.

Here is some information always use it with a grain of salt, because it does not be acurate or even outdated. I personally use it to explain some things or to remember stuff.


## General
* [Passwords](./passwords.md)
* [Encryption and Hashing](./encryption_hashing.md)
* [Principals](./principals.md)

## Security risks
* [OWASP](./owasp.md)

## Authentication and Authorization
* [OAuth2 / OIDC](./oauth2_oidc.md)
* [Kerberos](./kerberos.md)
